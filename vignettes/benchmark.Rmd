The `prioriactions R` package offers diverse optimization solvers, both academic and non-academic, to tackle mathematical models. Notably, it supports cutting-edge commercial optimization software such as `gurobi` and `CPLEX`, as well as non-academic alternatives like `CBC` and `symphony`. In the realm of supported solvers, `CPLEX` and `gurobi` generally stand out for their superior speed. It's worth noting that while these are commercial tools, they do offer special academic licenses at no charge.

Depending on the intricacy of the management planning problem at hand, solvers based on open-source software may only marginally trail behind their commercial counterparts in terms of the speed and quality of the solutions. In the following analysis, we will explore and evaluate the performance of these different software options that `prioriactions` provides.

## Experimental settings

This analysis encompassed the generation of prioritizations through all solvers available in `prioriactions`, accompanied by measuring the time and quality of the solutions (*gap*) each solver required to complete the process. We explored a set of management planning problems characterized by distinct models (referred to as models **(A)**, **(B)**, **(C)**). Among the models considered, **(C)** stands out for being the largest model due to the incorporation of spatial connectivity requirements between actions ($blm_k$ = 0.8). In contrast, model **(B)** entails connectivity solely between management units ($blm$ = 0.8), while model **(A)** lacks any form of spatial requirement. Consequently, solving model **(A)** should be comparatively straightforward, given its absence of spatial constraints (further elaborated in Table below with model sizes). Also, we introduce variations in the target achievement levels (10\%, 20\%, 30\%, and 40\% respectively), thereby altering the inherent attributes of the models. All benchmark scenarios encompassed the Mitchell River case study presented, i.e. 2,316 planning units, 45 features, and 4 threats.

```{r table1, tidy=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(Modelling_Setting = c("(A) $blm = 0, blm_k = 0$", "(B) $blm = 0.8, blm_k = 0$", "(C) $blm = 0, blm_k = 0.8$"),
                 Variables = c(43180, 61428, 89150),
                 Constraints = c(37371, 92115, 175281),
                 Nonzeros = c(136566, 264302, 458356))
knitr::kable(
  df, booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Model size (Variables, Constraints, Nonzeros elements in the constraint matrix) for different modelling scenarios.'
)
```


Our experimental setup was conducted on a machine powered by an Intel Core i5-1240P 3.30GHz processor, paired with 16 GB of RAM LPDDR5-6400MHz, and running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. Firstly, the `time_limit` parameter, which designates the maximum period the solver dedicates to pursuing an optimal solution, was set to 10,800 seconds, equivalent to a span of 3 hours. It is noteworthy that no constraint was placed on the *gap* to achieve (`gap_limit` = 0}), underscoring the aim of attaining the utmost optimal solution within the aforementioned three-hour timeframe. Secondly, the number of cores utilized was set to ten. Futhermore, we employed the most recent versions of all available optimizers within the `prioriactions` framework. Specifically, for `BM CPLEX`, we utilized version 22.1.1.0 in conjunction with `Rcplex` version 0.3.7. `Gurobi` was employed at version 10.0.0, while `Rcbc` was utilized at its version 0.1.0.9001. Additionally, for `symphony`, we leveraged `Rsymphony` with version 0.1-33 to ensure a comprehensive and up-to-date foundation for our analyses.

To derive these outcomes, we solely adjusted in the third step, involving the alteration of the solver's name within the `solve()` function embedded in the `prioriactions` package.

```r
# solve the model
solution <- solve(model, solver = "gurobi", gap_limit = 0, time_limit = 10800, 
                  solution_limit = FALSE, cores = 10, output_file = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
```

In the subsequent segments, we will offer distinct log outputs corresponding to each of the experimental solvers operating within scenario **(A)**, where the recovery target is set at 10%. These log records will serve as illustrative examples, providing insight into the information presented throughout the optimization process. 

### `Gurobi`

The logs follow a consistent structure, albeit with variations based on the information being presented and the manner of presentation. This structure can be succinctly summarized into four key sections: **(i) optimizer settings**; the initial part includes details about the settings and configurations of the optimizer (lines 1 to 8). **(ii) presolve**; to fine-tune the model. This step involves searching for the bounds associated with the relaxed solution (infeasible), among other tasks (lines 15 to 31). **(iii) solutions search**; entails an active pursuit of the optimal solution (or one of the optimal solutions, if multiple exist, lines 33 to 61). And,  **(iv) summary**; summarises the entire optimization process, providing quality *gaps* and times, among other things (lines 63 to 69). In this particular instance, the optimal solution (with a *gap* of 0.00%) was successfully attained, yielding a value of 646, 10 seconds after the process started.

### `CPLEX`

Similar to `gurobi`, the `CPLEX` log adheres closely to the outlined structure. Precisely, lines 3 to 9 correspond to **(i)**, while lines 10 to 30 encompass **(ii)**. Furthermore, lines 31 to 49 represent **(iii)**, and lines 51 to 63 represent **(iv)**. In this context, the optimal solution was swiftly identified within a mere 2.08 seconds while maintaining the identical objective value of 646.

### `CBC`

In the case of `CBC` solver, the log provides an even higher specificity level than its counterparts in `gurobi` and `CPLEX`. In this instance, the breakdown is as follows: lines 5 to 11 correspond to **(i)**, offering initial insights. Lines 12 to 66 delve into more intricate detailed aspects of presolve **(ii)**. Subsequently, lines 67 to 80 represent **(iii)**. Further along, lines 81 to 110 illustrate **(iv)**. Note that we have employed a stopping criterion set at 3600 seconds. This decision stems from the understanding that with this non-academic solver, an optimal solution might not be attained within a shorter timeframe (as it indeed was the case). This approach ensures that we are able to present the complete structure of the log output comprehensively. Thus, an optimal solution was not reached (*gap* of 0.04%). Instead, we found a solution with an objective value of 653, marking a distinction from the previous solvers’ outcomes, which converged at 646.

### `Symphony`

Contrary to the previous logs shown, `symphony` offers a minimalistic yet essential amount of information. As in `CBC`, we have set the stop criteria to 3600 seconds, for the same reasons. As noted, sections **(i)** and **(ii)** are omitted, while section **(iv)** only indicates the objective value of the solution achieved (lines 38 to 44). In turn, the section **(iii)** is similar to the log from `gurobi` and `CPLEX` (lines 8 to 36). Note that the most recent solution uncovered has a target value of 646. While it is currently evaluating whether this constitutes the optimal solution (reflecting a *gap* of 2.49%), it is pertinent to highlight that we are confident in asserting its optimality based on the solutions identified by `gurobi` and `CPLEX`.

## Results

We have conducted 48 tests, encompassing three distinct models (models **(A)**, **(B)**, and **(C)**) and spanning four recovery targets (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%). These tests were carried out across all four available solvers within the `prioriactions` framework, comprising two academic solvers(`gurobi` and `CPLEX`) and two non-academic alternatives (`CBC` and `symphony`).

### Academic solvers: `gurobi` vs `CPLEX`

Upon comparing the two academic solvers, a similarity in behaviour becomes evident. In the context of `gurobi`, optimal solutions were successfully achieved across all scenarios, as evidenced by **gaps** amounting to zero. Similarly, when employing `CPLEX`, we observed zero *gaps* across all scenarios, with the exceptions occurring in model **(C)** targeting 10%, where a gap of 0.73% emerged, and in model **(C)** targeting 30%, which exhibited a *gap* of 0.24% (see upper right box in previous Figure). Nonetheless, a consistent disparity becomes apparent in terms of processing times. `gurobi` consistently exhibited a lead in verifying optimal solutions across most scenarios, with only slight variations in model **(A)** (distanced by seconds). Assuming that `CPLEX` achieved optimal solutions in all instances, verification required an average of 3510.847 seconds. In contrast, `gurobi` outperformed with an average of 1365.47 seconds, representing approximately 39% of the time taken by `CPLEX` (see bottom boxes in the previous Figure).

### Non-academic solvers: `CBC` vs `symphony`

In this context, it is a more varied panorama, with `CBC` notably standing out. In 8 out of the 12 comparative analyses against `symphony`, `CBC` demonstrated superior solution qualities, as indicated by the upper boxes in Figure above. Furthermore, the average *gaps* achieved by `CBC` stand at 6.35%, while its counterpart averages 9.06%. Turning to run times, `CBC` exhibited the capability to verify optimal solutions ahead of `symphony` in model **(A)**, particularly with target restrictions of 30% and 40%. However, it is noteworthy that both solvers encountered challenges in validating the optimality of the obtained solutions in the remaining models (see bottom boxes in Figure above).

## Conclusions

The benchmark findings underscore the considerable variability in the time required to resolve multi-action management planning challenges. This temporal difference is contingent upon diverse factors, encompassing the problem's scale, intricacy, and the solver engaged in formulating the prioritization. Notably, specific solvers, such as the `symphony` solver, may demand several hours to address a predicament that could be resolved within minutes by other solvers like `CPLEX` or `gurobi.` In terms of recommendations, we advise prioritizing the utilization of `gurobi` and `CPLEX` solvers whenever feasible, as they frequently exhibit superior performance with respect to the non-academic solvers. While academics can avail special licenses for these solvers at no cost, it is crucial to recognize that conservation planners within governmental or non-governmental entities might not have access to these resources. In scenarios where access to the aforementioned solvers is limited, we propose the adoption of the `CBC` solver, which generally demonstrates better efficacy compared to `symphony.` 
In any case, due to the complexity of exploring in detail all the possible instances (number of units, species, threats and their respective combinations), we recommend being cautious with these results. Considering the intrinsic combinatorial nature of these models, even solvers as robust as `gurobi` may encounter difficulties when tackling exhaustive analyses.
