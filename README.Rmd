__This project was financed by the National Agency of Research and Development, ANID, Chile,  through the grant FONDECYT N.1180670 and through the Complex Engineering Systems Institute PIA/BASAL AFB180003. Also it has received funding from the European Union’s H2020 research and innovation program under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement N.691149 (SuFoRun).__

The _prioriactions R_ package uses a mixed integer mathematical programming (MIP) approach for building and solving multi-action conservation planning problems, where the goal is to find an optimal combination of management actions that abate threats, in an efficient way while accounting for connectivity. Furthermore, the flexibility of the package interface allows implementing an extended version of the base model for minimizing fragmentation between different actions. These models were called as MAMP and MAMP-E by Salgado-Rojas _et al._ (2020), where you can get a detailed description of how both problems were mathematically modeled.

Once built a multi-action conservation problem, the next step is to solve it. For this, the package has a variety of commercial and open-source exact algorithm solvers that guarantee to find optimal solutions. The models implemented here have three advantages over their heuristic counterparts: shorter execution times, higher solutions quality, and a solution quality guarantee.

## Installation

The latest development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/josesalgr/prioriactions/) using the following code.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("prioriactions/prioriactions")
```

## Usage

The _prioriactions R_ package works in three main stages. It starts with the `problem()` function that receives a set of data to create a valid data instance for the conservation problem. Then, the `min_costs()` function receives this data to create the mathematical model associated with this problem, which will finally be solved using the `solver()` function. A detailed description of these steps is illustrated below.

## Example

Quick guide to create and solve a multi-action conservation planning problem, following the three-step methodology already described.

### Step 1 
Load the "prioriactions" package into the R environment (remember to install it before using it).
```{r, message = FALSE}
library(prioriactions)
```
Load the necessary input data into the R environment.
```{r}
data(example_pu_data, example_features_data, example_rij_data,
     example_threats_data, example_sensibility_data, example_bound_data)
```
Create a "data instance" that stores and validates all input data.
```{r}
problem_data <- problem(
                pu = example_pu_data, features = example_features_data, rij = example_rij_data,
                threats = example_threats_data, sensitivity = example_sensibility_data,
                bound = example_bound_data
)

problem_data
```

### Step 2
Create an "optimization model" using the previously loaded "data instance".
```{r}
problem_model <- min_costs(x = problem_data, blm = 1, blm_actions = 1)
problem_model
```

### Step 3
Solve the "optimization model" using the available solvers.
```{r}
model_solution <- solve(a = problem_model, solver = "gurobi", verbose = FALSE, output_file =FALSE)
model_solution
```

Finally, report and interpret the solution to the problem you are working on.

Report the total cost of the conservation plan.
```{r}
solution_report01 <- model_solution$getObjetiveValue()
solution_report01
```

Report the planning units suggested to be included (value 1) and not included (value 0) 
within the conservation plan.
```{r}
solution_report02 <- model_solution$getSolutionUnits()
head(solution_report02)
```

Report the conservation actions that are suggested to be carried out (value 1) 
and not carried out (value 0) within the conservation plan.
```{r}
solution_report03 <- model_solution$getSolutionActions()
head(solution_report03)
```
