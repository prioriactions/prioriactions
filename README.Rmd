## Overview

The `prioriactions` package allows you to create and solve conservation planning problems that involve multiple threats and actions. This uses techniques of integer linear programming (ILP), obtaining optimal solutions or with a certain degree of guaranteed quality (gap). Due to its flexibility, the package offers the possibility of creating different mathematical models with multiple requirements (spatial, budget requirements, etc.). All the included models are presented in detail in Salgado-Rojas et al. (2020). The package has a variety of commercial and open-source exact algorithm solvers that guarantee to find optimal solutions.


## Installation

The latest development version of `prioriactions` can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/prioriactions/prioriactions/) using the following code.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(remotes)) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("prioriactions/prioriactions")
```

## Usage

You can browse the package documentation online at
<https://prioriactions.github.io/prioriactions/>.

If this is your first time using `prioriactions`, we strongly recommend reading the
[Introduction to prioriactions](https://prioriactions.github.io/prioriactions/articles/prioriactions.html)
vignette.

If you believe you've found a bug in `prioriactions`, please file a bug (and, if
possible, a [reproducible example](https://reprex.tidyverse.org)) at
