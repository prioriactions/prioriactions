# prioriactions 0.3.1

- Release candidate for CRAN.

# prioriactions 0.3.0

- Update all functions documentation.
- Rename `problem` function as `dataInput()` function for intuitiveness.
- Add `problem()` function to create different mathematical models instead of `minimizeCosts` and `maximizeBenefits`.
- Now `getPerformance()` function incorporate information of previous four functions (removed): `getGap`, `getStatus`, `getTimeSolving` and `getObjectiveValue`.
- Now `getModelInfo()` function incorporate information of previous three functions (removed): `getModelSense()`, `getNconstraints` and `getNvariables`.
- Add `getCost()` function to get information about the solution costs. The `getActionsCost`, `getPlanningUnitsCosts` and `getTotalCosts` functions are deprecated.
- Add `getConnectivity()` function to get information about the solution connectivity. The `getPlanningUnitsConnectivity`, `getActionsConnectivity` and `getTotalConnectivity` are deprecated.
- Add `getSolutionBenefit()` function to get information about the solution benefits. The `getBenefits` and `getTotalBenefits` functions are deprecated.
- Add `getPotentialBenefit()` function to get maximum benefits to achieve given a data.
- Add two different targets: recovery and conservation; the first related to the actions to abated threads, and the second related to keep planing units in benefit to features (without do actions).

# prioriactions 0.2.0

- Update *Mitchell River*, *Benefits and sensitivities* and *Get started* vignettes.
- Update all functions documentation.
- Add `threat` input with information on different threats within the exercise.
- Now rcpp functions work with pointers which allows to use less memory.
- Add parameters *a*, *b*, *c*, *d* for `sensitivity` input added. These parameters
allow work with different sensitivities curves of threats-features. In addition to the possibility to work with non-binary threat intensities.
- Now the `sensitivity` is an optional input.
- New `maximizeBenefits()` model function.
- Rename`min_costs` model function as `minimizeCosts()` model function for consistency.
- New `portfolio-class` objects to handle multiple solutions.
- New `evalBlm()` function to create and solve multiple models with different `blm` parameters.
- New `evalTarget()` function to create and solve multiple models with different `target` parameters.
- New `evalBudget()` function to create and solve multiple models with different `budget` parameters.
- Now all methods of the `solution-class` are available as functions for the `solution-class` and `porfolio-class`.

# prioriactions 0.1.2

- Update *Mitchell River* vignette.
- Add three new parameters to the function `solve()`; *name_output_file* is the name of the main output that is exported only if the *output_file* parameter is TRUE, and *name_log* is the name of the solver log (only using gurobi solver) that is exported only if the *log_file* parameter is TRUE.
- Fix `getSolutionActions()` and `getSolutionUnits()` functions of the `solution` object. Now these round the values assigned to each variable to the integer nearest.
- Fix `benefit()` function of the `solution` object. Now the calculation considers the amount of features and threats other than 1 and 0.
- Update `OptimizationProblemRcpp.cpp` file. Now the models considers the amount of features and threats other than 1 and 0.
- Fix typo that named files and variables *sensibility* instead of *sensitivity*. All documentation was updated.
- Fix issue where the `createtxt()` function did not close the export file correctly.

# prioriactions 0.1.1

- Rcpp implementation working.
- Fix internals id's for the proper functioning of the model creation.

# prioriactions 0.1.0

- Initial package version.
